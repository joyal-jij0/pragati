Krishi Sahayak AI: Detailed Feature Solutions
Here's a breakdown of key features designed to empower Indian smallholder farmers by tackling specific challenges identified in the problem statement, now including enhanced AI interaction capabilities:
1. Feature: Hyperlocal AI Weather & Advisory (Part of Gyan Dhara)
Problem Solved: Lack of timely, localized, accurate weather forecasts; inability to anticipate adverse weather; knowledge gap in translating weather info into farm decisions.
Solution Detail:
Data Integration: Aggregates data from IMD, global models (GFS, ECMWF), satellite imagery, and potential IoT sensors.
AI Forecasting: Utilizes ML models (LSTMs, Transformers) trained on historical, hyperlocal data for granular forecasts (temperature, rainfall, humidity, wind) for near-term and weekly periods.
Actionable Advisories (AI-Driven): Core AI analyzes forecasts against the farmer's crop, stage, and soil type. Generates simple, multilingual text/voice advisories: "अगले 3 दिनों तक बारिश नहीं होगी। गेहूं की फसल को पानी दें।" (No rain for next 3 days. Irrigate wheat.) "कल दोपहर भारी बारिश की संभावना है। कीटनाशक का छिड़काव आज ही पूरा करें या टाल दें।" (Heavy rain likely tomorrow afternoon. Spray pesticide today or postpone.)
Delivery: Visualizations (graphs, icons), text messages, in-app notifications, voice read-outs. Critical alerts via SMS.
Chatbot Integration: Farmers can ask the chatbot for current weather or forecasts ("कल मौसम कैसा रहेगा?" - How will the weather be tomorrow?).
Recommendation Link: The AI Recommendation Engine (Feature 10) proactively suggests actions based on forecasts (e.g., "Weather alert: High winds expected. Secure your crops/structures.").
